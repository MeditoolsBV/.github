<!--
Short description
-->

<!--
## Current situation

What is the current user-flow.
Where fitting, include screenshots or videos of the current pages or user-flow.

<!--
## Problem

What in the current situation is problematic.

<!--
## Solution

What steps are involved to get from the current situation to the desired situation.
This implies that taking these steps solves the problem.

If this includes bigger sections of work, add subsections here.
Attempt to describe these steps as a task-list.
Attempt to estimate how much time it will take to complete each of these steps.

Do the steps involved seem like too much work or hard to determine all at once? Scope the issue down or move the first step to a refinement sub-issue and continue from there.
